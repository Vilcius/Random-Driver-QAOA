# QAOA with random and subgraph driver Hamiltonians
The code used to generate the results in the paper https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18412.
This code is based on a fork of https://github.com/GaidaiIgor/MA-QAOA.

In order to generate results, run the command `python3.11 run_calculations.py` in the main directory. This will generate the results in the `results` directory.
